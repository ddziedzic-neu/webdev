    <h1><strong>My Plans</strong></h1>

    <q>You are not your job, you're not how much money you have in the bank. 
        You are not the car you drive. You're not the contents of your wallet.</q>
    <p>-Tyler Durden, "Fight Club"</p>

    <p>
        My plans after graduation are to find a sustainable job with a suitable work life balance.
        Inevitably after I've sorted out and planned my finances I'll probably take up travel and also experiencing
        some of the fun things I never got to as a child. <em>Hopefully</em> money can help with that. <br>
        I also want to continue my studies and learn further in departments like ethical hacking and also developing
        my own brand and business. The goal is to eventually become my own boss and dictate my own schedule. 
        Graduating is just one step to experiencing life as I want. Hopefully at the end of all of my work I can settle down.
    </p>
